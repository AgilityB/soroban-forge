# ForgeBot

**ForgeBot is a Soroban Forge automation tool. It is NOT an official Drips or
Stellar bot.** It is not built, endorsed, operated, or supported by Drips or the
Stellar Development Foundation, and it has no relationship to the Drips Wave
campaign infrastructure beyond helping this repository's contributors.

ForgeBot is the pull-request automation for this repository. It exists so that
contributors get fast, actionable feedback from the checks that **already** run
in CI, and so that maintainers can see at a glance whether a pull request is
ready for human review.

ForgeBot is implemented entirely with GitHub-native automation (GitHub Actions,
the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and the GitHub REST API). There is no separate
GitHub account and no GitHub App.

---

## Purpose

- Surface the results of the existing CI workflow on every pull request.
- Explain *which* check failed and point the contributor at the fix.
- Give a concise, non-binding "ready for review" signal once CI is green.
- Keep the number of bot comments to **one per pull request** — it is updated in
  place, never re-posted.

ForgeBot does not add new required checks. It reports the checks the repository
already defines.

## Contributor pull request flow

```
Contributor opens / updates a PR
        |
        v
Existing CI runs (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
        |
        v
ForgeBot reads the finished CI run and updates the single sticky comment
        |
        v
ForgeBot publishes the informational commit status "ForgeBot / ready-for-review"
        |
        v
Required human / CODEOWNER review
        |
        v
All required checks + required approvals satisfied -> PR is eligible for merge
        |
        v
GitHub native Auto-Merge may complete the merge (if enabled) — ForgeBot never merges
```

ForgeBot never replaces, and cannot replace, human maintainer review.

## What ForgeBot checks

ForgeBot runs **no checks of its own**. It reads the job results of the existing
`CI` workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and reports them:

| CI job | Check name on a PR |
| --- | --- |
| `rustfmt` | Rustfmt |
| `clippy` | Clippy |
| `build` | Build |
| `test` | Test |
| `audit` | Security Audit |
| `wasm-size` | WASM Size Check |
| `provenance` | Provenance Manifest |

It also flags, as **advisory only**, pull requests that touch repository
automation or security configuration, which should always get explicit
maintainer sign-off:

- `.github/workflows/*`
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `scripts/forgebot/*`
- `SECURITY.md`

## What ForgeBot can do

- React to pull-request CI runs (opened, reopened, new commits pushed, draft
  marked ready for review — anything that produces a CI run for the PR).
- Create **and update** one comment per pull request, identified by the hidden
  marker `<!-- forgebot:status -->`.
- Publish the informational commit status `ForgeBot / ready-for-review`
  (`success`, `failure`, or `pending` for drafts).
- Ignore superseded CI runs so the comment never reports stale results.
- Stay silent on cancelled CI runs so contributors are not pinged with a false
  failure.
- Be re-run manually with `workflow_dispatch` for a specific CI run ID.

## What ForgeBot cannot do

ForgeBot has **no** ability to:

- approve, dismiss, or request changes on a pull request;
- merge a pull request, or enable/disable Auto-Merge on it;
- bypass or edit branch protection, rulesets, required reviews, or required
  status checks;
- modify CODEOWNERS, issue templates, labels, assignments, or repository
  settings;
- create, close, reopen, edit, label, or assign **Wave issues**;
- change Wave campaign configuration in any way;
- request or use any secret other than the automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

ForgeBot cannot approve, so it can never satisfy a required review. Its commit
status is **informational by design** and should not be added to required status
checks: the required checks are the existing CI jobs, which are what actually
determine whether a change passes automated validation. Keeping ForgeBot
non-required means a transient bot/API problem can never block a valid PR.

## Human review requirements

Human review stays mandatory and is unchanged by ForgeBot:

- `@Meet-hybrid` is the CODEOWNER for the whole repository.
- Branch protection on `main` requires one approving review for contributor pull
  requests.
- CODEOWNER review, branch protection, required reviews, and required status
  checks are **not** modified by ForgeBot.
- ForgeBot's comment and commit status are informational; they are never a
  substitute for an approval.

## Permissions

ForgeBot requests the smallest permission set that makes it work. The workflow
sets `permissions: {}` at the top level (deny by default) and grants only these
scopes to its single job:

| Permission | Level | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contents` | read | read the default branch to run the reporter script |
| `actions` | read | read the finished CI run and its job conclusions |
| `pull-requests` | write | create/update the sticky comment on the PR |
| `statuses` | write | publish the informational ForgeBot commit status |

It does **not** use `write-all`, does not use `contents: write`, does not use
`issues: write`, and does not use any repository secret. The only credential is
the automatic `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, which is scoped to this repository
and expires with the job. No secret is printed to the logs.

## Security model

- **Trigger:** the workflow runs on `workflow_run` (CI completed) plus manual
  `workflow_dispatch`. It deliberately does **not** use `pull_request_target`.
- **No untrusted code execution:** the job checks out the **default branch only**
  and never the pull request head, so contributor-controlled code is never run
  with repository write credentials.
- **Fork PRs:** for pull requests from forks, the `pull_request` CI run has a
  read-only token, while the `workflow_run` job runs in the base repository with
  its narrow write scopes. Contributor code is still never executed there.
- **Secrets:** no repository secrets are available to, or required by, the job.
- **Input validation:** the run ID, head SHA, and pull request number are
  validated before they are used in API paths; API responses are parsed with
  `jq` rather than shell-evaluated.
- **Comment ownership:** ForgeBot only updates comments authored by
  `FORGEBOT_LOGIN` (`github-actions[bot]`) that carry its own marker, so it
  cannot be tricked into editing a contributor's comment.
- **Credentials:** `persist-credentials: false` on checkout; nothing is pushed.

## Bot identity

The automation is called **ForgeBot**. Because it is implemented with GitHub
Actions, the GitHub account that authors the comment is
**`github-actions[bot]`**, not a dedicated "ForgeBot" account. This is stated
honestly in the comment footer: ForgeBot is the *automation*, and
`github-actions[bot]` is the *identity executing it*.

Creating a dedicated GitHub App would require manual external setup
(account/App creation, private key storage as a secret, installation on the
repository). Nothing in this repository does that automatically, and it is not
required for ForgeBot to work. If a dedicated App identity is ever wanted, the
only change needed here is `FORGEBOT_LOGIN` in `.github/workflows/forgebot.yml`
and a token-issuing step.

## How maintainers can disable or tune ForgeBot

- **Disable completely:** delete `.github/workflows/forgebot.yml`, or disable the
  workflow in **Actions → ForgeBot → "…" → Disable workflow** (this setting
  lives in GitHub, not in the repository).
- **Stop reporting on pushes only:** no change needed — pushes to `main` are
  already filtered out.
- **Pause for a specific PR:** no per-PR switch exists by design. Remove the
  sticky comment and disable the workflow if it must be silenced.
- **Re-run for a run:** **Actions → ForgeBot → Run workflow** with a `run_id`.
- **Remove the commit status:** delete the "Publish the informational commit
  status" block in `scripts/forgebot/status-report.sh` step 9.
- **Change wording/protected paths:** edit `scripts/forgebot/status-report.sh`
  (tuning) and `.github/workflows/forgebot.yml` (permissions, triggers).

## Manual GitHub settings required

Repository files cannot configure everything. These settings live in the GitHub
UI and must be set (or verified) by a maintainer. Each is optional except where
noted:

| Setting | Where | Required value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Actions workflow permissions | Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions | "Read repository contents and packages permissions" (or "Read and write" with the workflow's own `permissions:` block kept in place) | Ensures the default token is not broader than ForgeBot's explicit scopes |
| Allow GitHub Actions to create PRs | Settings → Actions → General | Any value; ForgeBot does not create PRs | ForgeBot needs no PR-creation right |
| Branch protection / ruleset on `main` | Settings → Branches (or Rules → Rulesets) | Require a pull request before merging; required approvals ≥ 1; require review from CODEOWNERS if desired; require status checks = the existing CI checks | Guarantees human review and keeps ForgeBot informational |
| Required status checks | Settings → Branches → required checks | The seven existing CI checks only: Rustfmt, Clippy, Build, Test, Security Audit, WASM Size Check, Provenance Manifest. **Do not** make `ForgeBot / ready-for-review` a required check | Auto-merge only completes when required checks pass; leaving ForgeBot informational means a transient bot/API hiccup cannot block an otherwise valid PR |
| Allow Auto-Merge | Settings → General → Pull Requests → "Allow auto-merge" | Enabled (recommended for the campaign) | Lets GitHub complete the merge once required reviews **and** required checks are satisfied |
| "Require approval for first-time contributors" | Settings → Actions → General (fork PR approval) | Maintainers' choice | Decides whether a maintainer must approve a first CI run from a fork before it executes |
| Dismiss stale approvals / require conversation resolution | Settings → Branches | Maintainers' choice | Hardening beyond ForgeBot |

Until these manual settings are verified, ForgeBot will still comment on pull
requests, but the repository is not fully campaign-ready: Auto-Merge and
required-check gating depend on the branch protection configuration, which only
exists in GitHub.

> Note: `workflow_run`-triggered workflows only fire once
> `.github/workflows/forgebot.yml` exists on the **default branch**. Until this
> branch is merged/pushed to `main`, ForgeBot does not run at all.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No ForgeBot comment on a PR | The workflow file is not on the default branch yet | Merge/push `.github/workflows/forgebot.yml` to `main` |
| No comment, CI green | The CI run was cancelled, or a newer run superseded it | Re-run the `ForgeBot` workflow with the CI `run_id` |
| Comment never appears for a fork PR | The fork PR's CI run has not been approved/executed yet | Approve the workflow run as a maintainer |
| Duplicate comments | A maintainer/contributor deleted the marker, so the sticky comment could not be found | Delete the extras; ForgeBot will keep one going forward |
| `could not publish commit status` warning | The status was rejected (e.g. token scope or SHA state) | The comment is still posted; check the run logs — status is informational only |
| Comment is stale | CI is still running for the newest commit | ForgeBot updates the comment when that run completes |
| ForgeBot noise on every push | Should not happen: one comment per PR, updated in place | Verify the marker `<!-- forgebot:status -->` is present in the comment |
